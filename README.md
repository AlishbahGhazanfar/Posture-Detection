# MediaPipe Holistic Model for Posture Detection

This project utilizes the MediaPipe Holistic model to detect facial, hand, and pose landmarks in real-time from a webcam feed. The detected landmarks are visualized on the video feed, and a machine learning model predicts the body language class and its probability.

## Features

- Real-time detection of face, hand, and pose landmarks using MediaPipe.
- Visualization of detected landmarks on the video feed.
- Prediction of body language class with associated probability.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mediapipe-holistic-posture-detection.git
   cd mediapipe-holistic-posture-detection
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a webcam connected to your computer.

2. Run the script.

3. A window will open showing the webcam feed with detected landmarks and predicted body language class.

4. Press `q` to exit the program.

## Examples
